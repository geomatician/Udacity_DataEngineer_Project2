Only the first unique (song_title, user_id) combination will be kept when inserting data into the table and this will still tell us the name of the user that listened to that song. In short, Cassandra will keep one record (a single listening session) and reject all other duplicate records (all other listening sessions in which the same user listened to the same song, if any).
